**_Flutter_** and **_React Native_**, two of many cross-platform frameworks, are the most popular representatives from 2018 till now. Therefore, there are many comparisons about them. But, I, who is a Web Developer with the strengths of Javascript and React, from my perspective, hope to show you the differences and my true feelings while learning Flutter.

# 1. Statistic

In recent years, the widespread growth of _Mobile_ has been very noticeable. As a result, the development of _Mobile App_ is also inevitable. If you look at the _statistics_, the facts will surprise you even more:

As you can see, more than _<u>200B</u>_ _mobile apps_ were downloaded in _2019_ and <u>_120B USD_</u> was spent by users. What an incredible number. Therefore, the need to create Mobile apps more quickly and easily is also growing. And that's also the driving force behind the the release of cross-platform frameworks like **_React-Native_** (2015, _Facebook_) and **_Flutter_** (2017, _Google_). With the increasing demand from Dev and tremendous support from the titans: _Facebook_ and _Google_, **_React-Native_** and **_Flutter_** quickly took the biggest market share. **_React-Native_** was released first in _2015_, so it's pretty straightforward that it's still more popular than others. But, if you look at the following graph, you will see that **_Flutter_** is making amazing progress and will overtake **_React-Native_** in a very short time:

And if you want to know the reasons why **_Flutter_** is making such rapid progress, please follow me to the next section.

# 2. Comparision

## a. Language

- _<u>Javascript</u>_ is the language of **_React-Native_**. With the wide coverage of _Javascript_, from both the _Backend_ _(Node.js_), the _Web_ _(Browser)_, and now the _mobile_, and due to its simplicity and familiarity to the Dev community, _Javascript_ became the huge advantage of **_React Native_**. That's why that framework becomes my very first option which I - a _ReactJS Developer_ - think about when needing to build a new mobile app from scratch.

- Unlike **_React Native_**, **_Flutter_** uses _Dart_ lang - a fairly new language, so the community can't be as large and popular as Javascript. At a glance, _Dart_ is also a programming language created by Google itself, with the purpose is solving _Javascript's_ problems. However, _Dart_ is _OOP_ (as well as _Java_ and _C++_), so there is no doubt that it would be a huge difficulty if I decided to learn it. It would take time, and I have to switch back my mindset from _Functional Programming_ to _OOP_ again. On top of that, according to [Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved), _Dart_ is more loved by developers than _JavaScript_:

  In return, _Website_ or _Web platform_ can be created by using **_Flutter_**. This is a fairly wide coverage of the FE side: from iOS -> Android -> Web.

==> Obviously, if you are also a *Web FE Develope*r like me, using **_React Native_** with familiar _Javascript_ will be a massive advantage.

## b. Architecture

- **_React Native_** enables the communication between _JavaScript_ and the native language via the _JavaScript bridge_. Here’s how it works: the two sides communicate by sending _JSON messages_. The messaging is _asynchronous_, which means the app’s UI should be smooth. Still, there’s a chance of a _lagging_ UI in the end because the bridge impacts the rendering speed.
- In contrast, **_Flutter_** doesn’t require a bridge to communicate with native components. It has everything packed within itself, including frameworks like _Cupertino_ and _Material Design_. Thanks to this [Flutter advantage](https://relevant.software/blog/top-8-flutter-advantages-and-why-you-should-try-flutter-on-your-next-project/), apps are more stable and predictable than **_React Native_** apps when applying to different platforms.

## c. Performance

- As you can see, in the _Architecture_ section, I already mentioned that _React Native_ might gets a chance of lagging because of the _JavaScript_ bridge. There is a detailed benchmark result made by **_inVerita_**, and you can check out that post [here](https://inveritasoft.com/blog/flutter-vs-react-native-vs-native-deep-performance-comparison).

  ==> Follow the result, you can see that **_Flutter_** has quite better performance than **_React Native_**.

## d. Code

- First, it is highly likely that you would have a hard time with **_Flutter_** if you were already familiar with _JSX_ in _ReactJS_ and _React Native_. In addition, styling Widgets in **_Flutter_** has also been a big problem when there is no standard (there is no such thing as generic _CSS classes_ or _stylesheets_), which makes this more tedious compared to **_React Native_**.

## e. Packages

- In **_Flutter_**, everything will be installed automatically. Instead of connecting with Xcode Cocoapods, developers just need to add package name into _pubspec.yaml_ file, then run _"flutter packages get"_.
- On the other hand, packages in **_React Native_** must be installed by _npm_ _(Node Package Manager)_, by running the command "npm install package-name". Especially, a few packages are also required to use _React-Native link_ or connect with _Xcode Cocoapods_, which is quite a complex progress.

# 3. Conclusion

In conclusion, both frameworks have their own pros and cons, so there are no winners or lossers. As a _Web Dev_, it is for sure that I am more familiar with **_React Native._** However, I didn't have many problems when I tried learning **_Flutter_**. I must say that **_Flutter_** is very worth trying so I highly recommend it.

Here is a quick recap of the main points of this section:

|                       | _React Native_                                                       | _Flutter_                                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who easy to learn** | Familiar with _Javascript_, especially _ReactJS_.                    | Familiar with _OOP_, like: _C++_, _Java_, ...                   |
| **Architecture**      | Transferred to UI thread via the _JavaScript_ bridge.                | Uses its own widget library.                                    |
| **Packages**          | Install via _npm_, few packages require complex progress to install. | Has own packages manager, easy to use, everything is automatic. |

_<u>P/S:</u>_ Please take into account that this tutorial carries personal viewpoints of me, a very new guy in **_Flutter_** so if there are any mistakes, please kindly comment and let me know. I would love to receive any feedback whether positive or negative. That is also a great motivation for me to conduct the next sharing. Many thanks.
