# Introduction

A brief about myself: I'm a _Web Developer_, and **_ReactJS_** is my strength. In addition, I've used **_React Native_** (a cross-platform library which also use _Javascript)_ for building several native apps. Then, I heard about **_Flutter_** and its impressive improvement in 2019. The more I learned about **_Flutter_**, the more fascinated I got. Therefore I decided to write this post to share the knowledge Iâ€™ve learned and my own experiences when applying it.

In this post, I will try to implement a horizontal list of a very popular mobile app: _Facebook Messenger_. I will try all my best to make this widget has flexible height, that means it can be reused in many layouts. And if you are getting to know **_Flutter_**, I believe that there are some helpful insights you can find in this post.

# Implementation

## 1. Preparing

There is no doubt that the first thing you need is creating a new **_Flutter_** project. If you don't know how to do that, **_Flutter_** had a very detailed guide on its website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive

## 2. Creating model, mock data

First, you need to create _user_model.dart_ to store _User model_

```dart
class UserModel {
  int id;
  String img;
  String name;
  bool active;
  bool hasStory;

  UserModel({
    this.id,
    this.img,
    this.name,
    this.active = false,
    this.hasStory = false,
  });
}
```

Then, you create _data.dart_ file to store your mock data:

```dart
import 'package:list_item_demo/user_model.dart';

var tmpId = 1;
const mockImages = [
  'https://www.w3schools.com/howto/img_avatar.png',
  'https://www.w3schools.com/howto/img_avatar2.png',
  'https://www.w3schools.com/w3images/avatar2.png',
  'https://www.w3schools.com/w3images/avatar5.png',
  'https://www.w3schools.com/w3images/avatar6.png'
];

List<UserModel> mockUsers = [
  UserModel(
    id: tmpId++,
    img: mockImages[tmpId % mockImages.length],
    active: true,
    name: 'Person 1',
    hasStory: true,
  ),
  UserModel(
    id: tmpId++,
    img: mockImages[tmpId % mockImages.length],
    active: true,
    name: 'Person 2',
  ),
  UserModel(
    id: tmpId++,
    img: mockImages[tmpId % mockImages.length],
    name: 'Person 3',
  ),
  UserModel(
    id: tmpId++,
    img: mockImages[tmpId % mockImages.length],
    name: 'Person 4',
  ),
  UserModel(
    id: tmpId++,
    img: mockImages[tmpId % mockImages.length],
    name: 'Person 5',
  ),
];
```

Okay, you've done preparing for _Model_ and _Data_.

## 3. Creating Users List widget

Now, you are going to do the most important (and also the most difficult) step in this tutorial, that is implementing **_Users List_** and **_User Item_** widget.
First, you will need to create _users_list.dart_, then create **_Users List_** widget:

```dart
class UsersListWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<UserModel> data;

  UsersListWidget({this.data});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    List<Widget> listWidgets = [];

    return ListView(
      scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
      children: listWidgets,
    );
  }
}
```

- _Note:_ you only need _StatelessWidget_ here, because you don't need state in this widget. You can read more about the differences of _Stateful_ and _Stateless_ in [this link](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/interactive#:~:text=If%20a%20widget%20can%20change,are%20examples%20of%20stateless%20widgets.&text=A%20widget's%20state%20is%20stored,widget's%20state%20from%20its%20appearance).

After that, you use _UsersListWidget_ in _main.dart_:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  final String title;
  final List<UserModel> data = mockUsers;

  MyHomePage({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Container(
        height: 140,	// if we success, the layout will be ok although we change this height to any value.
        child: UsersListWidget(data: widget.data),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Then, let'sl move to the implement of **_User Item_** widget:

Creating the widget:

```dart
class UserItemWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final UserModel data;

  UserItemWidget({this.data});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
    	children: [],
    );
  }
}
```

As you can see, there are several parts in an **_User item_**: <u>_Rounded Avatar Image_</u>, <u>_User's Name_</u>, <u>_Story Circle_</u>, and _<u>Active Indicator</u>_. So, you will do each part one by one respectively. The first one is the _<u>Avatar</u>_:

- Adding a square image by using _Aspect Ratio_:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Column(
    children: [
      Expanded(
        child: AspectRatio(
          aspectRatio: 1,
          child: Ink.image(
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
            image: NetworkImage(data.img),	// to get the image from the url
          ),
        ),
      )
    ],
  );
}
```

![Square Images](https://i.imgur.com/aJTzATf.png#center)

- Then, making the images rounded by adding _Material_ widget with _MaterialType.circle_:

```dart
AspectRatio(
  aspectRatio: 1,
  child: Material(
    clipBehavior: Clip.hardEdge,	// this line
    type: MaterialType.circle,	// and this line make the image become round
    color: Colors.transparent,
    child: Ink.image(
      fit: BoxFit.cover,
      image: NetworkImage(data.img),
    ),
  ),
),
```

- Adding some space between items:

```dart
return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded( ....
```

- Here is the result. As you can see, the _Rounded Avatar Image_ has been done.

![Completed Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/gFNLdvx.png#center)

Next is <u>_User's Name Text_</u>:

- Follow the design, _Name Text_ is placed under _Avatar_. So, we will put the _Text_ right under _Expanded_ of _Avatar_ widget:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(...),
          Text(
            data.name,
            maxLines: 2,	// text will have 2 lines limitation.
            overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,	// if text is longer than 2 lines, will show "..."
          )
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
```

- The result will look ok. **BUT**, when you try chaging user's name to a very long text, the result is different from Messenger's. The long text will make the width of item wider instead of breaking into the second line.

  ![THIS IS LONG TEXT FAIL PICTURE](https://i.imgur.com/LkxLAmU.png#center)

  ==> **_EXPLANATION_**: we want to make the width of the _Item_ base on the _image_ but not the _text_. But, _Column_ widget doesn't have <u>restriction</u> for the <u>width</u>, so it will have the width of its widest child. In order to get what we want, we need to use another widget: _Stack_. _Stack_ also contains list of widgets (like _Column_), but its dimension is just base on the first child - that's what we want:

```dart
return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: Stack(
              children: [
                AspectRatio(	// Avatar is first child => decide dimension of Stack.
                  aspectRatio: 1,
                  child: Material(...),
                ),
                Positioned.fill(	// use this widget to place other children of Stack base on first child.
                  child: Align(
                    alignment: Alignment.bottomCenter,	// Text is placed at the bottom center of the first.
                    child: Text(
                      data.name,
                      overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
                      maxLines: 2,
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          )
        ],
      ),
    );
```

![Text Name 2 lines but overlap](https://i.imgur.com/sTXKozS.png#center)

- Seems that the text can break into 2 lines and has ellipsis correctly, but it's overlap with the Avatar (it's the result of _Stack_). So, we will add few widget to correct it:

```dart
double marginAvatarName = 4;	// space between avatar and name
double nameMaxHeight = 35;	// max height of user's name (2 lines)
```

```dart
return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: Stack(
              children: [
                Column(	// add Column widget here, to place other items under Avatar
                  children: [
                    Expanded(
                      child: AspectRatio(
                        aspectRatio: 1,
                        child: Material(
                          clipBehavior: Clip.hardEdge,
                          type: MaterialType.circle,
                          color: Colors.transparent,
                          child: Ink.image(
                            fit: BoxFit.cover,
                            image: NetworkImage(data.img),
                          ),
                        ),
                      ),
                    ),
                    SizedBox(height: marginAvatarName), // work like margin
                    SizedBox(height: nameMaxHeight),	// (A) => mimic the space for the name (same with B)
                  ],
                ),
                Positioned.fill(
                  child: Align(
                    alignment: Alignment.bottomCenter,
                    child: SizedBox(	// (B) => has the same height with SizedBox above
                      height: nameMaxHeight,
                      child: Text(
                        data.name,
                        overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
                        textAlign: TextAlign.center,	// align text to center
                        maxLines: 2,
                      ),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          )
        ],
      ),
    );
```

- Okay, looks good. Seems that we've finished _User's Name_.

![User's Name completed](https://i.imgur.com/UR8Dskw.png#center)

Next is _<u>Story Circle</u>_:

- As you can see, _Avatar_ is overlap with _Story Circle_, so I will use _Stack_:

```dart
 Column(
   children: [
     Expanded(
       child: Stack(	// add stack here
         children: [
           Padding(
             padding: const EdgeInsets.all(4.0),	// space between avatar and story circle
             child: AspectRatio(
               aspectRatio: 1,
               child: Material(
                 clipBehavior: Clip.hardEdge,
                 type: MaterialType.circle,
                 color: Colors.transparent,
                 child: Ink.image(
                   fit: BoxFit.cover,
                   image: NetworkImage(data.img),
                 ),
               ),
             ),
           ),
           Positioned.fill(
             child: CircularProgressIndicator(	// story circle
               value: data.hasStory == true ? 1 : 0,
             ),
           ),
         ],
       ),
     ),
     SizedBox(height: marginAvatarName), // work like margin
     SizedBox(height: nameMaxHeight),
   ],
 ),
```

- Actually, _CircularProgressIndicator_ is the progress circle, but you can use it as a circle here with a little trick as you can see. If value is null, that widget will be in loading state with fancy animation.
- Okay, _Story Circle_ is done.

![Story Circle Completed](https://i.imgur.com/E7BN6L8.png#center)

The last one - _<u>Active Indicator</u>_:

- About the shape, it contains 2 concentric circles: 1 bigger has the same color with background, and a smaller which is green. But, the most difficulty of this widget is its position. It takes me about half an hour to solve it. And this is my solution:

![Frame Image](https://i.imgur.com/22VEnYL.png#center)

![Real Wireframe](https://i.imgur.com/QaboeKf.png#center)

- And here is my implementation:

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    Expanded(
      child: Stack(
        children: [
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(4.0),
            child: AspectRatio(
              aspectRatio: 1,
              child: Material(
                clipBehavior: Clip.hardEdge,
                type: MaterialType.circle,
                color: Colors.transparent,
                child: Ink.image(
                  fit: BoxFit.cover,
                  image: NetworkImage(data.img),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          Positioned.fill(
            child: CircularProgressIndicator(
              value: data.hasStory ? 1 : 0,
            ),
          ),
          if (data.active)	// just show active indicator if active
          Positioned.fill(	// it's also a layer overlap with the avatar
            child: Align(
              alignment: Alignment.bottomRight,	// place the bigger box at the bottom right of avatar circle
              child: FractionallySizedBox(	// same with SizedBox, but height and width is percent.
                heightFactor: 0.5,	// 50%
                widthFactor: 0.5,	// 50%
                child: Align(
                  alignment: Alignment.centerRight,	// place the smaller box the center right of bigger box.
                  child: FractionallySizedBox(
                    heightFactor: 0.5,	// 50%
                    widthFactor: 0.5,	// 50%
                    child: Material(	// Outer circle
                      clipBehavior: Clip.hardEdge,
                      type: MaterialType.circle,
                      color: Colors.white,	// same color with background
                      child: Padding(
                        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(2.0),	// space between outer and inner circle
                        child: Material(
                          clipBehavior: Clip.hardEdge,
                          type: MaterialType.circle,
                          color: Colors.green,	// inner circle has green color
                        ),
                      ),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          )
        ],
      ),
    ),
    SizedBox(height: marginAvatarName),
    SizedBox(height: nameMaxHeight),
  ],
),
```

- So this is your final result:

# Conclusion

In conclusion, although this is just a simple widget, we still get some experiences: how to manage the dimension of widget, how to use stack, the think to make the flexible widget, ... Please take into account that this tutorial carries personal viewpoints of me, a very new guy in **Flutter** so if there are any mistakes, please kindly comment and let me know. I would love to receive any feedback whether positive or negative. That is also a great motivation for me to conduct the next sharing. Many thanks.

_<u>P/S:</u>_ as mentioned below, I'm a _Web Developer_, _React_ and _Javascript_ are my cores. So, I will have a post to compare between **React-Native** and **Flutter**, and share my difficulties when starting to learn **Flutter** as a _Javascript_ _Dev_.
